* Mmcoops oops/panic logger

Mmcoops is an oops/panic logger that write its logs to MMC before the system crashes.
Introduction and concept are similar to other oops logger.
(Refer to Documention/ramoops.txt)
- Disadvantage: if MMC is occurred an oops/panic, this logger can't work.

After reboot, you can get the last log with below command.
Count is size in bytes over block size (512). 512000/512=1000
#dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/tmp/dump.log skip=1048576 count=1000
#vi dump.log

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be "mmcoops"
* start-offset: block-offset for start.
* size: the number of block to write oopses and panics.

Example:
	mmcoops {
		compatible = "mmcoops";
		start-offset-blk = <1048576>; /* The starting block */
		size-bytes = <512000>; /* Size in bytes */
	};
